# Apex Legends Autoexec
This is an in-depth autoexec for Apex Legends, it is a combination of my personnal and other autoexecs I found online such as [Couleur's](https://github.com/couleur-tweak-tips/utils/blob/main/Patchers/Apex%20Settings%20Patcher/autoexec.cfg). You'll find a bunch of optimizations that will make your game look awful but give you an incredibly smooth experience with a constant 300 fps in most scenarios and very good visibility.
